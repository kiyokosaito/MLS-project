# MLS-project
Machine Learning and Statistics assessment

# Machine Learning and statistics assessment Winter 21/20

### This is an assesment for Machine Learning and Statistics, deadline is on 19th December 2021


### This MLS-project contains two jupyter notebooks.

1. Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
2. Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook

#### Each notebook contains overview of scikit-learn and scipy stats python libraries.
###### For Scikit-learn jupyter notebook, 3 algorityms will be covered with examples and fidings. Plots and visualisations will be added to the notebook to enhance examples and fidings.
###### For Scipy Stats jupyter notebook, ANOVA will be tested wutg a data set and the resutls will be displayed by using scipy.stats. Again, Plots and visualisations will be added to the notebook to enhance examples and fidings.
